    <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a UI/UX designer with over a year of experience. I love using Figma to design user-friendly and good-looking digital stuff.<br>

    I think design can make things easier and more enjoyable for people. I enjoy creating plans, trying out ideas, and making sure every detail looks just right.</p>
